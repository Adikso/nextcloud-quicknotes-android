# Resume
In current state, it only implements the basic CRUD functions.. So, you can:
* Create Notes
* Read Notes
* Update Notes
* Delete Notes

# Limitations:
* It only implements edit the title, content, and color. if you save a note, you will lose attachments, tags or shares.
* It can display the HTML quite well, but if you save a note, you will lose the formatting.
* It only works with the nextcloud client installed. I don't expect to create a custom login!
* It works 100% online, without any type of cache.
* **Needless to say, it was barely tested..**. ðŸ˜…  hahaha.
