## Resume:

## Limitations:
* It only implements edit the title, content, colors, and pin your notes.
* You can view the tags, shared notes, attachments, but can not change them.
* It only works with the nextcloud client installed (and I don't expect to create a custom login.)
* It works 100% online, without any type of cache.
* **Needless to say, it was barely tested..**. ðŸ˜…  hahaha.
